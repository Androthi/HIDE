HIDE Project Jobs

Building HIDE
	Make a duplicate of the HIDE folder and call it HIDE_WORK
	HIDE_WORK should be located in the same directory level as the HIDE folder
	Make menu commands build and run HIDE.exe in the HIDE_WORK folder

	HIDE and HIDE projects should be placed in a path that does not
	contain white spaces.

Building the Lexer
	If scanID.txt has changed, this executes the script to rebuild
	genLexer.hhf and genLexer.hla
	The lexer has multiple dependents, it is adviseable to rebuild the
	entire HIDE job upon changes to scanID.txt to insure proper execution.


HIDE
	This builds the main IDE
	
	
Output folder may be changed using Project Manager
