IDE for the HLA programming language

This is a HIDE project file, use HIDE to compile.
You can download HIDE from https://sites.google.com/view/androth/home/high-level-assembly

The project is setup to look for a HIDE_WORK folder in the same tree level as the HIDE folder as a build target. This build target folder should be a copy of a standard HIDE folder.
